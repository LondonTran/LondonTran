Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is London Tran and I am a software developer specializing in Flutter. So far, I have published two mobile apps in the Google Play Store. I am currently working on MoodApp, a Flutter mobile app that gives users the power to express their current mood to friends and family without saying a word.
